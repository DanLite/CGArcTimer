This code uses Quartz (Core Graphics and Core Animation) to demonstrate resizing images, drawing graphics, blend modes, and simple animation.  I created it to test a component for my [EVTrack iPhone app](http://bit.ly/EVTrack1).

Sprite taken from [Pok√©mon Amethyst sprite project](http://www.smogon.com/forums/showthread.php?t=65162).

Code is free for any use.
